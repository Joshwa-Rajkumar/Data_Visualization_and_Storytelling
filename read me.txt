Project Title: Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel
Submitted by: Joshwa Rajkumar
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel 2013

Project Summary:
This project was intended to be done in Power BI, but due to hardware limitations on my laptop, I created a dynamic and interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel instead. The dashboard visualizes overall sales performance, top-performing products, regional comparisons, and monthly breakdowns using charts, slicers, and pivot tables.

Features Included:

KPI Tiles:
Total Sales: $12,506,815.51
Total Profit: $2,239,711.13
Total Quantity Sold: 27,507 Nos
Average Discount: 25%

Filters for Interactivity:
Region-wise (Central, East, South, West)
Year-wise (2023, 2024, 2025)
Segment-wise (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
Monthly Breakdown (Jan to Dec)

Charts & Visualizations:
Sales Over Time: Line chart showing monthly trends across years
Sales by Region: Column chart comparing regional performance
Top 10 Products by Sales: Horizontal bar chart
Top 10 Products by Profit: Horizontal bar chart

Methods Used:
Used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to summarize and visualize large datasets.
Applied Slicers for multi-dimensional filtering and interactivity.
Used Excel formulas for KPI metrics.
Styled the dashboard to give a clean and professional report-like appearance.

Challenges Faced:
Power BI could not be used due to system constraints, so Excel was used creatively as an alternative.
Ensured responsiveness by keeping data model light, and optimizing formulas and chart ranges.

Conclusion:
Despite the limitations, this project demonstrates strong data analysis and visualization skills using Excel. It delivers actionable insights in a user-friendly layout, mimicking the interactivity of a Power BI dashboard.
