Tast 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

1. Power BI could not be used due to system constrains, so Excel was used creatively as an alternative.
2. Ensured responsiveness by keeping data model light, and optimizing formulas and chart ranges.
3. Watched couple tutorials on Youtube, especially Alex the Analyst, If I had Power BI it would be great to find some time to tell the story and visualization instead of wrestling with adjusting size and colours.
